- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

In the future I'd like to have videos start at the exact time where the recipe is being explained so that those visiting the site can get right to it.

I would also implement a field for a reservation that gives you only availible dates and times, which automates the ability to prevent overbooking at a certain timeframe.

I would also implement a link into the terms of use and have a pop-up functionality for it so that people have the ability to read them. If not a pop-up, at least a section of text above the checkbox for people to read them.
